Python-3.13.2-amd64.exe                             -->     %localappdata%\Temp\SRSPython\Python-3.13.2-amd64.exe -- Delete this directory on close of installer
Check for the presence of %localappdata%\Temp\SRSLog\rcvr.log and move the rcvr.log file out of that directory and place it in %localappdata%\SRSBot\Log_Files\rcvr.log then delete the folder in the Temp directory (after all, its temporary). If there is no SRSLog directory, then skip this step.

Recovery Platform Manager Requirements and placements: SRS_Recover.exe - Log to %localappdata%\Temp\SRSLog\rcvr.log
    The Recovery Platform will do everything that the installer does, however, it will also fetch the unins000.dat and unins000.exe from GitHub, a copy of these things will be bundled with the installer. 

Item placements and content. 
    Main window will have 4 buttons. Each button is one step with the fourth being a "rebuild all" button. 
    Button 1:   "Rebuild file structure"
        Step 1: Remove srs_env and place it in                                  -->     %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\Crit\srs_env\*
        Step 2: Remove Bot_Items and place it in                                -->     %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\Crit\Bot_Items\*
        Step 3: delete %localappdata%\SRSBot folder
    Button 2:   "Retrieve Files" This will go to GitHub and fetch the following files and place them in the corresponding directories
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/dist/Launcher.exe         -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\dist\Launcher.exe
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/dist/Package_manager.exe  -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\dist\package_manager.exe
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/Verifier.py               -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\Verifier.py
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/Removers/unins000.dat     -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\unins000.dat
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/Removers/unins000.exe     -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\unins000.exe
    Button 3:   "Assemble"
        Step 1: Move %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\Crit\srs_env\*                  -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\srs_env\*
        Step 2: Move %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\Crit\Bot_Items\*                -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\Bot_Items\*
        Step 3: Verify the integrity of srs_env and Bot_Items
        Step 4: Delete the %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\Crit directory (only if all files were properly moved)
    Button 4:   "Recover All"
        Step 1: go to GitHub and fetch the removers directory.
        Step 2: Edit unins000.dat to instruct unins000.exe to remove the entire SRSBot folder from %localappdata%, keeping intact the removal of python from the users system.
        Step 3: Edit unins000.dat to omit %localappdata%\SRSRecovery directory from the uninstall process.
        Step 4: go to GitHub and initiate the download of the installer from the releases section, looking for the latest release. 
        Step 5: Start cmd.exe and instruct it to wait for 5 seconds. In those 5 seconds, close SRS_Recover.exe. When the 5 seconds elapse, delete the %localappdata%\SRSRecovery Direcotory from the system then launch srsbotinstaller.exe from the users downloads folder, then close the cmd.exe instance. 

package_manager handling of files. - Log to %localappdata%\SRSBot\Log_Files\Pkgmgr.log
Adjust the package manager to handle the files and locations differently to how it currently does. 
Item placements and content. 
    Main window will have 6 buttons. and a progress bar at the bottom, it will fill based ont he file sizes and completion rate of updating. 
    Button 1:   "Get Updates"
        Step 1: Check for a manifest.txt at https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSManifest/manifest.txt if it does not exist, proceed with full update of all components
        Step 2: If manifest.txt exists download it to %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\Files\manifest.txt and check what files need to be updated based on the timestamps next to the file names. If the timestamps do not differ from the local manifest.txt skip them. 
        Step 3: If manifest.txt has timestamps differing for either launcher.exe or Verifier.py then close the correcponding application. (ie. if Verifier.py has a timestamp where the date and time are ahead of the local manifest.txt file, then force close it ahead of the update)
        Step 4: Download the files directly to their destinations. 
                Fetch the following and place in the appropriate locations
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/dist/Launcher.exe         -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\dist\Launcher.exe
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/Verifier.py               -->     %localappdata%\SRSBot\Verifier.py
                https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/dist/SRSRecovery.exe      -->     %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\SRS_Recover.exe

        Step 5: Update the unins000.dat file to include the updated items (in the event the user wishes to remove the SRSBot Suite)
        Step 6: Prompt the user if they wish to return to the launcher
            If yes --> open launcher.exe and close package_manager.exe
            if no  --> dismiss dialogue box and do nothing.
    Button 2:   "Uninstall Bot"
        Step 1: Open dialogue box to prompt the user if thay are sure they wish to proceed
            If yes
                Stage 1:    copy the bot_items directory to the users desktop and open a dialogue box "Your Launcher token, channel and roles have been placed in a Bot Items folder on your desktop\nAre you sure you wish to proceed.\nThere is no turning back if you do. 2 buttons, "Proceed" and "Abort"
                Stage 2:    If "Proceed"
                    Step 1: Dismiss prompt
                    Step 2: Update unins000.dat to include the the entire %localappdata%\SRSBot directory.
                    Step 3: Launch unins000.exe
                    Step 4: Force close package_manager.exe and any other running processes from within the SRSBot folder (except unins000.exe)
                Stage 2a:   If "Abort"
                    Step 1: Prompt user "We have restored your Bot Items files."
                    Step 2: Delete the Bot Items folder from the users desktop
                    Step 3: Dismiss the dialogue box after user clicks "OK"
                    Step 4: Abort the launch of unins000.exe
            If no  --> dismiss the prompt and do nothing. 
    Button 3:   "Share Bot"
        Step 1: Open Dialogue box: "Would you like to share a link or the installer?"
            User presses "Share Link" --> put the link into the users clipboard for https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot
            User presses "Share file" --> go to https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot and start he download for the installer from the packages section.
            User presses "Never Mind" --> Dismiss dialogue box and do nothing. 
    Button 4:   "Quit"
        Step 1: Quit package_manager.exe
    Button 5:   "Recovery"
        Step 1: Dialogue Box "You are about to start the bot recovery process. Continue?" 
            User presses "Yes" open SRS-Recover.exe and close dialogue box then package_manager.exe (Double check that Verifier.py is not running and check that Launcher.exe is not running. If they are, terminate them.)
            User presses "no"  Dismiss dialogue and do nothing. 
    Button 6:   "Return to launcher"
        Step 1: Run Launcher.exe
        Step 2: terminate package_manager.exe



Launcher.exe will not change its behavior or functionality other than - Log to %localappdata%\SRSBot\Log_Files\BotLauncher.log
    Rename the Package Manager button to Manage installation
    Adjust all buttons to be the same width and centered, one each side. 
    Add a fifth button "Stop Bot" in the middle below the 4 buttons, spanning the total width of the 4 buttons. (basically, keep it alligned and centered)

    "Manage Installation" button functionality
        On click:
        Step 1: Check to see if the Package Manager is in the manifest.txt file on GitHub. If the timestamp is unchanged proceed to step 1a
            Step 1a: update the local manifest.txt file entry found at %localappdata%\SRSRecovery\Files\manifest.txt for the package manager then proceed to Step 2. 
        Step 2: Download the package_manager.exe in place at %localappdata%\SRSBot\dist\package_manager.exe from GitHub
        Step 3: Run package_manager.exe from SRSBot\dist\package_manager.exe
        Step 4: Close launcher.exe

We will tackle the Verifier.py file as necessary!
