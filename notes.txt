files are being all placed into %localAppData%\SRSBot 
    The bot items are in the bot_items folder. 

There are 3 major folders inside SRSBot on the users computer! 
    bot_files
    updater
    bot_items

Inno installer needs to install the files in the following places, and from the following places, indicated by a --> to their destination. 

Step 1: The installer

C:\Users\Alex Edwards\Documents\GitHub\SRSBot\
    dist\Launcher.exe             -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.exe
    dist\package_manager.exe      -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.exe
    package_manager.spec          -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.spec
    package_manager.py            -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.py
    Launcher.spec                 -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.spec
    Launcher.py                   -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.py
    Verifier.py                   -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Verifier.py
    srsenv\                       -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\srsenv (the folder)
    imagery\boticon.ico           -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\boticon.ico
    imagery\SRSLogo.ico           -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\SRSLogo.ico
    imagery\SRS Discord Logo.png  -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\SRS Discord Logo.png
    imagery\SRS Logo Official.jpg -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\SRS Logo Official.jpg



We want to have a desktop icon made for the Launcher, called "SRSBot Launcher"
launcher icon is found at 
    C:\Users\Alex Edwards\Documents\GitHub\SRSBot\Imagery\Boticon.ico 

Step 2: The package_manager
Package manager does 3 major things. It checks for updates, installs updates and enables the uninstallation of the bot, launcher and itself, and it allows a person to bundle up the bot to share it with friends. 

Step 3: Updates for the Package manager
To start he update process, The updater needs to go to the github repository and fetch the following stuff! 
    https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/ --> Files for direct fetch and integration
        Launcher.spec                 -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.spec
        Launcher.py                   -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.py
        dist\Launcher.exe             -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.exe
        Verifier.py                   -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Verifier.py

Step 4: Removing the SRSBot and all files. 
    1. The updater will rewrite the unins000.dat file to include everything within the SRSBot folder, and the folder itself, so that the user can completely remove the bot itself. 
    2. The updater will copy the contents of the bot_items folder and create a file on the users desktop called "Saved Bot Info.txt"
        The file will be laid out as below:

        Discord Bot Token
        "   "

        Welcome Channel
        "   "

        Pre-Verification Role
        "   "

        Verified Role
        "   "
    3. The updater will then delete the contents of bot_items
    4. The updater will then run unins000.exe
    5. The Updater will close itself the launcher and Verifier.py applications so the uninstall can be done. 

Step 5: Updating the package manager
    1. Add a butotn called "pkg" to update the package manager itself. 
    2. go to https://github.com/Fir3Fly1995/SRSBot/ --> Files for direct fetch and integration
        dist\package_manager.exe      -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.exe
        package_manager.spec          -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.spec
        package_manager.py            -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.py
    this will be directly integrated into the SRSBot\updater folder, no need for a manifest or anything like that, it will just outright replace the files directly from GitHub. 
We will handle a more discrete method for ensuring the most up-to-date pkg_mgr is available for use by integrating it into another function of the launcher. 


Tickers
    Launcher
        Default to display is "Standing By..." 
        on click of Package manager
            "Downloading Package Manager Updates" during the download. 
            "Installing Updates" Display this for 3 seconds (because the updates are installed as they are downloaded, its a fake delayy to give the illusion of updates happening)
            "Launching Package Manager" Display this for 3 seconds, then continue to launch the package manager, and to close the launcher as specified above. 
        
        On click of "Write Data" button
            "Data saved Successfully..." on successful completion for 3 seconds, then revert back to "Standing By..."

        On Click of "Start Bot"
            "Starting Bot..." for 3 seconds, then proceed to the next step of the launch process. 
            "Standing By..." after the 3 second timer expires. 
            Pop-Up Dialogue Box --> The bot has been started. \n\n The command to start the bot itself is copied to your clipboard. \n\n 1. Click on the PowerShell (blue space in the opened window) \n 2. Press Ctrl + V \n 3. Hit the enter key \n\nThank you!
                offer OK option to dismiss the dialogue box. 
        On click of "Quit"
            "Terminating Launcher. \n Thank you for using the SRS Bot." Wait 3 seconds, then terminate the launcher. 

    package_manager
        Default to display is "Waiting Input"

Step 6: Get the bots stuff! 
The path for the bot token, channel and the names of the roles are located at
    %Localappdata%\SRSBot\Bot_Items\
        Token               --> token.txt
        Welcome Chanenl     --> channel.txt
        Pending Role        --> roles.txt -> line 1
        Verified Role       --> roles.txt -> line 2
    These should be automatically imported to Verifier.py or, placed into Verifier.py or, Verifier.py should look for these items in their appropriate locations!
