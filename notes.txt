files are being all placed into %localAppData%\SRSBot 
    The bot items are in the bot_items folder. 

There are 3 major folders inside SRSBot on the users computer! 
    bot_files
    updater
    bot_items

Inno installer needs to install the files in the following places, and from the following places, indicated by a --> to their destination. 

Step 1: The installer

C:\Users\Alex Edwards\Documents\GitHub\SRSBot\
    dist\Launcher.exe             -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.exe
    dist\package_manager.exe      -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.exe
    package_manager.spec          -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.spec
    package_manager.py            -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\Updater\package_manager.py
    Launcher.spec                 -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.spec
    Launcher.py                   -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Launcher.py
    Verifier.py                   -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Verifier.py
    srsenv\                       -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\srsenv (the folder)
    imagery\boticon.ico           -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\boticon.ico
    imagery\SRSLogo.ico           -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\SRSLogo.ico
    imagery\SRS Discord Logo.png  -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\SRS Discord Logo.png
    imagery\SRS Logo Official.jpg -->     %LAD%\SRSBot\bot_files\Imagery\SRS Logo Official.jpg



We want to have a desktop icon made for the Launcher, called "SRSBot Launcher"
launcher icon is found at 
    C:\Users\Alex Edwards\Documents\GitHub\SRSBot\Imagery\Boticon.ico 

Step 2: The package_manager
Package manager does 3 major things. It checks for updates, installs updates and enables the uninstallation of the bot, launcher and itself, and it allows a person to bundle up the bot to share it with friends. 

Step 3: Updates for the Package manager
To update the Package manager, we will tuck a hidden feature into the updater or the launcher. but we will handle that a little later. 

Step 4: Removing the SRSBot and all files. 
    1. The updater will rewrite the unins000.dll file to include everything within the SRSBot folder, and the folder itself, so that the user can completely remove the bot itself. 
    2. The updater will copy the contents of the bot_items folder and create a file on the users desktop called "Saved Bot Info.txt"
        The file will be laid out as below:

        Discord Bot Token
        "   "

        Welcome Channel
        "   "

        Pre-Verification Role
        "   "

        Verified Role
        "   "
    3. The updater will then delete the contents of bot_items
    4. The updater will then run unins000.exe and will close the updater, launcher and Verifier.py applications so the uninstall can be done.
