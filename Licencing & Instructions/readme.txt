--Info--
Please read these instructions prior to running the bot. 
This Verification bot is the Property of Fir3Fly1995 and created in 2025/02/08. Its purpose is to
verify that the person entering your Discord Server is doing so from the RSI website. 

This means the person has to have an RSI account, and their profile is not set to private or hidden. 
The bot requests that the user enters !verify. It will then provide them a 6 digit code which they must put
on their RSI short bio (Future functionality will be added to enable the code to be placed in the long bio also. 

Further functionality will be added to this bot to enable data entry for the records of Discord ID and RSI UEE Record Number (2 security numbers)
to be added to a spreadsheet within Google Docs. 

You need to setup Discord Developer access to use this, and to activate Developer options within Discord first before

--Plans--
-LAUNCHING
I plan to make it so that this bot can be started with a single batch file within Windows. For now, I am having issues with how windows handles the 'Pause' statement so it keeps the cmd.exe window open to allow the program to run. But, I will get this done to simplify the launch process. 

-In Discord
I fully plan to convert the bot into a form that it will use built in / commands, so it can prompt auto-completion within Discord Natively. Meaning the user is not left guessing. 

-Setup
Finally, I hope to make a GUI that will modify the code for the bot on first run, eliminating the need to have instructions or to search manually in the bot itself for the fields.
