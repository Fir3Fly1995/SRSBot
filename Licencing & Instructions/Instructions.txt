SETTING THE DELETE FUNCTION
1. In Discord, go to your Verification channel and send the following message
	This is the final step. My colleague will take over from here to verify that you actually have an RSI account. To get started type `!verify` My colleague will then respond and give you a `6-Digit code` which you need to place into your [RSI Profile - Short Bio](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/account/profile). When you have finished that, return here and enter `!verify RSI_Username` and hit enter. If the code matches, you get access to the server and never have to look at this channel again! 
2. Right click the message and select "Copy Message ID"

NOTE: "# await ctx.author.send" on line 30 has # before it to comment it out. This will be put back in once I have figured out how to get the bot to communicate back to your Discord Server that the verification was successful and gives the Verified Role.
