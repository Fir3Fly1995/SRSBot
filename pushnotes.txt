Nr. 68 - Cant revert, going to go nuclear!                          I hate that this really does not want to work at all... but, hey, thats life. 
Nr. 69 - Nuclear run complete. Starting fresh, and repairing damage I hope! 
Nr. 70 - Setting up emergency recovery and preparing file structure This should assist with app functionality
Nr. 71 - Reset layout in notes.txt                                  This should ensure exact mirroring... of what I hear you ask??? Of the grains of sand in the desert! 
Nr. 72 - Unable to package app files                                This is going to take a battle and a half to rectify, I think...
Nr. 73 - Rolled back to Python 3.8 and rebuilt                      Will it work??? We may never know!
